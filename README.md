# Introduction
  Shop & Chef is a disposable grocery list application. 

   This application is designed for those who are experienced home chefs, or newcomers to home cooking, combining food shopping with new, exciting, and inspiring recipe suggestions. 

## Description/User Story 
  AS A USER I want an app that will allow me to link my grocery list with potential recipes
  WHEN I use Shop & Chef 
  THEN I will enter my log-in credentials

  WHEN I input an ingredient
  THEN it will be added to a list

  WHEN I select a specific ingredient on my list
  THEN I am prompted with potential recipes to use this ingredient

  WHEN I have a recipe I like
  THEN I can save this to a list of favorite recipes


### Scope of Work
Users can easily add items of their choosing to thier shopping list. If they are looking for recipe inspiration, the app has a feature to seach for recipes based on main ingredient as well. 

To streamline the experience of creating a shopping list based on recipes, Shop & Chef allows users to add ingredients directly from recipes to their shopping list with a click on the ingredient. 

The application also alows users to save and retrieve their favorite recipes. 

# Usage/Installation
## Running the application: 
  In the terminal, run the following commands:
* `npm install express`
* `npm install express-session`
* `npm install --save sequelize`
* `npm install passport`
* `npm install ejs`
* After completing your installations, begin the server in your integrated terminal by running the command: `node server.js`

If the connection is successful, you will see: 

`ðŸŒŽ  Listening on port %s. Visit http://localhost:%s/ in your browser`

### Sequelize
  Sequelize is a promise-based Node.js ORM which we utilized to streamline usage with MySQL.

  Installation:

`npm install --save sequelize`

### Node.js

Express is the application that we utlized the most through node.js. The servers that we created route to the HTML data and the other to API for the data. 
We are running the GET, POST, PUT, & DELETE methods for the data. We render the necessary data to the front end using EJS.
We also used Passport nodejs middleware for user authentication.
Passport Installation: 
`npm i passport` 

### EJS View Engine
We use EJS Tempelating Engine to render our data as HTML Markup to be viewed on the front end. Through using EJS to create templates for our pages we were able to eliminate redundant code and create more streamlined, dry code for the application.  
Installation
` npm install ejs`
 
### jQuery
We use jQuery to handle event listeners and AJAX calls to the backend. Our AJAX calls were responsible for our functions carrying data from user logins, sign ups, recipe retreival and display. 

### Axios
We utilized Axios to handle all of our third party API are done with Axios to keep them hidden. 

### AJAX
We used AJAX for all of our front end API calls. 

### CSS
Our styling was created using Bootstrap for our navbar, buttons and user input fields. We used Bootswatch for our theme, and quite a bit of custom css written for placing the background image, font styling, custom color schemes and other fine tuning of the application's appearance. Included in our custom css styling is a google font to style all of the text in our application.
